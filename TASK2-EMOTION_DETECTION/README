Installation Steps :

Step #1: 
Install Libraries:

Firstly, I installed the required libraries, OpenCV, and NumPy. You can install it easily through:
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv
For installing NumPy in your system, use the same command as above and replace ‘opencv-python’ with ‘numpy’:
pip install numpy
pip install tenesorflow2.0



Step #2: 
Import Modules :
import cv2
import numpy as np
from keras.models import load_model
from time import sleep
from tensorflow.keras.utils import img_to_array
from keras.preprocessing import image


Step #3: 
Add Xml files :
cascade_face = cv2.CascadeClassifier('C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Lib\\site-packages\\cv2\\data\\haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

Add Classifier Model :
classifier =load_model(r'E:\CODE CLAUSE\TASK2-EMOTION_DETECTION\model.h5')

Step #4: 
Detect Faces:

Now, you must configure your camera and connect it to your system.
The camera should work properly to avoid any issues in face detection.
Before our camera recognizes us, it first has to detect faces.
We’ll use the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. 
It is primarily an object detection method where you train a cascade function through negative and positive images,
after which it becomes able to detect objects in other photos.


Steo 05 :
Detection Emotion :
An image processing and classification method has been
implemented in which face images are used to train a dualclassifier predictor that predicts the seven basic human
emotions given a test image.
The predictor is relatively successful at predicting
test data from the same dataset used to train the classifiers.
