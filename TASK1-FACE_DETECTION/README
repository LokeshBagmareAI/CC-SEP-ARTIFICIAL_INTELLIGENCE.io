Installation steps :

Step #1: 
Install Libraries:

Firstly, I installed the required libraries, OpenCV, and NumPy. You can install it easily through:
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv
For installing NumPy in your system, use the same command as above and replace ‘opencv-python’ with ‘numpy’:
pip install numpy

Step #2: 
Import Modules :
import cv2
import numpy as np


Step #3: 
Add Xml files :
cascade_face = cv2.CascadeClassifier('C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Lib\\site-packages\\cv2\\data\\haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')


Step #4: 
Detect Faces:

Now, you must configure your camera and connect it to your system.
The camera should work properly to avoid any issues in face detection.
Before our camera recognizes us, it first has to detect faces.
We’ll use the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. 
It is primarily an object detection method where you train a cascade function through negative and positive images,
after which it becomes able to detect objects in other photos.
